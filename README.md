What's The Weather Like

Part 1

Randomly generate 500 or more cities and get current weather data.

Create charts based on Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed.  Latitude is used to compare the values.

Added a sleep on the call to the API to avoid going over my limit of calls per minute.

Part 2

Using the data from Part 1, create a heat ,map based on the Humidity.  

Identify places with "ideal" weather and find a hotel in each of those cities.

Plot the the city and allow the hotel to be displayed when the marker is clicked on top of the heat map.
